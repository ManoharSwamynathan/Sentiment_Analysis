Eventually I was told to go away and obtain an estimate and email it back to  for it to be considered which puzzled me as I thought that I was covered anyway?
I emailed the estimate after a few days to the claims person as requested and within a few days I was sent a cheque less my excess which was good however it was so impersonal there was no acknowledgement to my email and the estimate no further contact was made with me either via telephone or email from the claims dept ...so much for the personal touch  advertises.",NA,18,,,,

They sent out a surveyor and he told me that they can to the repairs cheaper but would only repair the damaged part of the ceiling and as we have a through lounge the ceiling would look very odd one part covered with ceiling tiles and the other side not. So was not very impressed and when after two weeks I hadnt heard anything from them I contacted them and was told that as the surveyor had been out he would be dealing with all the clame and to contact him that was not what I was accepting when I then told them he had not even given me any contact details all he was concerned about was that I did not have a matching item policy and said that all he was going to do.

Found very helpful and process was easy with a cost saving that made my like for like policy worthwhile changing to. However when the policy came through I noticed that my bungalow was noted as 3 bedroomed not 2. Followed up to correct the error and in doing so it was also noted that I was down as a home owner not a tenant. Further conversation noted that I didnt have enough cover for my bicycle. All was quickly rectified but as a particular note it is really important to read the policy documents to ensure that they are correct. Not something Id say am always best at. Made me realise that I may have become unstuck had I needed to make a claim in the future. Would still recommend. Good value and excellent service.,I would recommend  to a friend,18,,,,

As there were several problems this was not good though everybody did their best The claim was cancelled without our knowledge during the first week. We had Marley tiles under the tank which contain asbestos. One man said he was happy to leave them so we agreed (hence he cancelled the claim) but the drying machine man said he could not dry us out without the tiles being tested so a couple of weeks were wasted and so it went on. We eventually got dried out and the claim resolved.

Initially called a local plumber and he said to smash the tiles off around the ensuite shower as that was where the leak was coming from. That didnt make sense to me given the location of the leak - indeed it was the  claims assessor who took time to try to work out the cause of the leak and finally found it - a small leak from the pipe that feeds the toilet cistern in the main bathroom (so nothing to do with the ensuite as the local plumber had suggested).

She arrived on time and was very impressive and fair - I dont think she would be conned by false claims!

The greatest difficulty I encountered was when I wanted to do a new quote altogether as it seems to result at first in the old quote number being used instead of the new one. However customer services are able to rectify it when you draw their attention.
There werent really any strange or awkward questions to be answered except that standard construction was assumed to be bricks and tile with no reference to slate.
There was a further reduction in price for already having another policy with  which was welcome.
Once the purchase is made policy documents arrive within a few days.",I would recommend  to a friend,18,,,,

It took two weeks for the place to dry properly but another two weeks for someone to come and repair the ceiling. Then a couple more weeks for the new plaster to dry before they came and did all the decorating, very nice too. The problem was with the company they use as a main contractor for floors etc, they messed up big time and eventually just gave up.

The person I spoke to had little knowledge about bikes.  gave me 3 options a hugely lowered cash settlement or replacement like for like from their supplier or credit note some 24% higher than the cash amount. I preferred to use a local supplier however due to financial constraints applied to them by the insurance company they couldnt offer me anything near my loss.

A flood is very stressful I had no experience of so did not know what to do or expect. I did expect the Loss Adjuster to be helpful and efficient.
Their first visit they did not even bring a damp meter to determine the extent of the damage. This appeared to be a theme they where more interested in claiming mileage and leaving their dryers and dehumidifiers in than progressing the job. My neighbour a builder was also flooded. The builders I got in is also a friend so helped. These advising me so I could ask the Loss Adjuster.
In summary it took over a week to get the heaters and dehumdifiers in over three weeks before they agreed the kitchen needed re-plastering!
I was passed through 3 or 4 people at the Loss Adjuster.
It did improve over the months!

I made a claim after the first H & S issue was incorporated and by this time I was out of what I would consider reasonable time after the event for making a claim.

Very easy to get through on phone and someone came out to inspect the damage within the week. They were very honest and flexible over whether to use their workmen for the repair or they would give me the money and I could sort it out myself.

I opted for the money and I confirmed bank details and they promptly did a bank transfer for the amount less the excess. All communication apart from the initial call was via email directly to one contact who I could call directly if required. No messing around with lots of different people or call centres - the whole process was very painless easy and smooth.

I contacted  to express my concerns and disappointment but was directed to company X to resolve the issues - a waste of time as surveyor X and contractor Y obviously had a close working relationship and X clearly didnt want Y to be seen in a bad light.
We were then left waiting for the 2 replacement garage doors to be fitted and again after numerous delays/excuses the doors were fitted early August.

I usually contact the insurer to ascertain if they can match or at least reduce the premium to an acceptable level which sometimes works but not always.
Shopping around this time I found that 
produced a very acceptable quote which my previous insurer did not even try to come near and therefore I have changed. Hopefully when the renewal is next due the premium will still be competitive.
I would recommend paying an additional ï¾£3. for the policy booklet etc. to be sent out by post as printing it uses a fair amount of paper and ink.

Since it is becoming more popular I suspect that they will have to get it eventually. The idea that one-size-fits-all is incredibly outdated now. Self employed people share possessions between work and personal use - heavens even the Inland Revenue understand that. But not insurance companies.

Still I eventually got pretty well what I wanted - at quite a high premium - except some weird stuff like my laptop isnt insured in Europe (on the mainland). Why???

No other company would insure my camera because it belongs to my business but I also use it personally -  did so that was a real plus. Initially they didnt want to cover it in Europe but relented on that - hurrah!

I found the site easy to navigate and to purchase the cover we needed (I especially liked the feature of seeing how your premium is broken down). The insurance documents are easy to read and follow as well as seeming a lot shorter than most other policies Iï¾ve seen in the past. The online policy portal is also well laid out easy to use and navigate so another bonus! We always tend to purchase the additional Personal Belongings to cover us outside the house and abroad as most travel insurance policies have an insufficient amount of personal belong cover and small valuable limits.

When I mentioned this to my family they were astonished so I decided to try elsewhere.  had already cut the annual cost of my car insurance by over ï¾£X and it even went down the following year so it seemed to be a good place to start.

The representative to whom I spoke over the phone was very friendly but it was somewhat annoying that he kept having to refer my case to a higher authority. All told the proceedings took about an hour. The written documentation contained errors.

In the end however it was worth it as the annual cost was cut by somewhere around ï¾£X.

Of course insurance is only good if it meets your needs and the real test will be if I ever have to make a claim. Obviously I hope this will not happen but only time will tell.

I was assured that the same policy conditions would apply to the new policy number; this was NOT the case and caused considerable effort in sorting out but with a review next year although I had the policy with CU then NU then  for over 30 years and no change of property and not a single claim!

We contacted the insurers who had previously covered the house but found their premium to be ridiculously high bearing in mind its history and level of contents (practically none).

I rang  as they cover our existing home and was delighted by the service.

The agent took minimal details to allow her to quickly check with the underwriters and then once they agreed to give cover she went through all the information needed.

As we have five years NCD on our own home this was extended to the new house. Cover for falling trees was included as standard (unlike the other insurer referred to above) which we need as the new house has several trees in the garden.

The agent was pleasant helpful and cheerful. The policy was tailored to suit us regarding cover and excesses and I could not have be happier.",I would recommend  to a friend,18,,,,

Other companies rang me up and tried to convince me that they offered better cover but the prices were far higher. On a like for like basis  were the best and the web site lets you chop and change to suit your exact requirement.
Obviously the proof of the pudding will be if I have ever to make a claim and hopefully I will not have to.
I look forward to obtaining a quotation for my car insurance when due.",I would recommend  to a friend,18,,,,

I was not so pleased when I rang on Friday 18th January (just one day after my renewal) because I thought I had a problem with my heating system pump to be told that I do not qualify for call out for 14 days. I think this is grossly unfair. I do not commit fraud and had had my emergency cover with another insurer for at least 3 years and have never used it. I had in fact paid my premium a week before I needed to and  were quite happy to take my full years payment. The problem I had with my heating pump seems to have resolved itself but I did not feel very happy about this and the fact that I might have had to call out another heating engineer if the problem had persisted.

As it is important for correct answers to be given I believe it is essential to give the customer a written record of what was said.

On top of good cover levels and a decent premium the offer of a loyalty discount for already having car insurance with  and M&S vouchers was a plus. We searched all the usual comparison sites but with a lower premium the offers and being a well known company we decided to switch.

Online sign up was a simple process and with online documents and policy servicing it means we are in control and have access to the documents online anywhere. It is nice to know we can amend the policy online to avoid admin fees that at some companies are stupidly high for even the smallest of changes.

When I called customer services to ask a few questions they were polite friendly and helpful.

Overall a quick and simple sign-up process for a product with better cover levels and premium.",I would recommend  to a friend,18,,,,
